We try to get a general term for the problem.

Variables:
a = button a presses 
b = button a x movement
c = button b presses
d = button b x movement
e = prize x
f = button a y movement
g = button b y movement
h = prize y

We press the button a a certain amount of times and the button b a certain amount of times.
These times are multiplied with the respective coordinate movements of the buttons and should equal the respective coordinate of the price.
When we do this for the x and y coordinate respectively, we get these equations that we can solve:

a * b + c * d = e
a * f + c * g = h

Solving for a and c:
ab + cd = e     | - cd
ab = e - cd     | / b
a = (e - cd) / b

Solving for c
((e - cd) / b) * f + cg = h
(fe-cdf)/b + cg = h     | * b
fe - cdf + cgb = hb     | - fe
-cdf + cgb = hb - fe
c(gb - df) = hb - fe    | / (gb - df)

Result:
c = (hb - fe) / (gb - df)
and
a = (e - cd) / b
